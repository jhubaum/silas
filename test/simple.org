Here is some text

* This is a section
Some text in a section
** With a subsection
and some more text
* And another top-level section
And now I have a slightly more complicated text. It even contains a newline.
After this sentence a new paragraph starts.

However, until now the only punctuation has been a dot (which changed with this sentence). The text even contains some *bold* and /italic/ text. Have I forgotten any punctuation marks? Yes, an exclamation mark!

* Block tests
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
This is a comment block with some content.
Again, it has multiple lines. Isn't that fun? I don't think so...
#+END_COMMENT
