Here is some text

* This is a section
Some text in a section
** With a subsection
and some more text
* And another toplevel section
And now I have a slightly more complicated text. It even contains a newline.

However, until now the only punctuation has been a dot (which changed with this sentence). The text even contains some *bold* and /italic/ text.
