Here is some text

* This is a section
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: first
:END:
Some text in a section
** With a subsection
and some more text

A previous version didn't support *bold text* at the beginning of a line.
*Does it work now?*
* And another top-level section
And now I have a slightly more complicated text. It even contains a newline.
After this sentence a new paragraph starts.

However, until now the only punctuation has been a dot (which changed with this sentence). The text even contains some *bold* and /italic/ text. Have I forgotten any punctuation marks? Yes, an exclamation mark! I can even use a slash/however you want to call this character.

Now, some other kinds of objects:

[[https://jhuwald.com][A link]]

An image with some html attributes:
#+ATTR_HTML: :style float: right; margin: 20px
[[/img/bumper-sticker.jpeg]]

* Block tests
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
This is a comment block with some content.
Again, it has multiple lines. Isn't that fun? I don't think so...
#+END_COMMENT

And here is a quote, followed by a list:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I said something super smart
--- Someone quoteable
#+END_QUOTE
- This is an unordered list
- It has three entries
- This is the last one
